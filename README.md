Face Recognition Web Application

Overview
This assignment aims to evaluate your proficiency in full-stack web development, with a focus on
integrating AI functionalities. You will build a Face Recognition Web Application that utilises
React.js, Angular.js, Vue.js or any Javascript framework of your choice for the frontend, Node.js
and Express.js for the backend, and an open-source AI model for face recognition(face api.js).
The application should be deployed using a serverless architecture, demonstrating your ability to
leverage cloud resources efficiently.

Objective
Developing a web application that captures live webcam data and employs face recognition
technology to identify and tag faces in the webcam feed not only showcases proficiency in
full-stack development but also a deep understanding of AI integration and serverless
deployment, highlighting the ability to create interactive, real-time applications that leverage the
latest in cloud computing and machine learning advancements for a seamless user experience.
